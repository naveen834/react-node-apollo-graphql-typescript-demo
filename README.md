# react-node-apollo-graphql-typescript-demo

run npm start 

go to http://localhost:4000

first register and then login 

wait for 15s to logout

to login either refresh or login again

need to work on creating refresh token when no refresh happens and user is still logged in , although this could be done by incresing access token lifetime but let say the user is logged in for a time longer than access token lifetime and he/she does not refreshes screen
